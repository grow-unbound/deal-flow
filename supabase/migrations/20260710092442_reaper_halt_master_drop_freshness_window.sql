-- Fix: step 5's master-halt detection required the permanently-failed slave
-- to have updated_at within the last 3 minutes ("did THIS pass just reap
-- it"). That window doesn't survive a migration deploy landing between a
-- slave failing and the next reaper tick — the slave's own error_log message
-- already conclusively means "permanently exhausted, halt the master",
-- independent of when it happened. Drop the freshness requirement entirely;
-- match on the message alone.
