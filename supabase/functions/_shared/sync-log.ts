/**
 * Lightweight checkpoint logging for sync orchestration diagnostics.
 *
 * Purpose: when a phase invocation hangs with no further heartbeat_at
 * movement (the products/transaction-line-items incidents), there was no
 * way to tell which step it died in — Zoho fetch, a specific persist
 * step, a specific DB helper — since none of that emitted anything.
 * console.log output is captured into Supabase's edge-function logs, so
 * the next time a job hangs, filtering logs by job_id and reading the last
 * checkpoint line tells you exactly where it got stuck, without needing a
 * debugger or stack trace.
 *
 * Kept dependency-free (no imports) so both sync-utils.ts and
 * integrations-persist.ts can use it without creating a circular import
 * (sync-utils.ts already imports from integrations-persist.ts).
