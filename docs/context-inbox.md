# Context inbox

Proposals from `/wrap` for the core instruction files. Nothing here is loaded automatically. Review, mark, then run `/context-review`.

Mark each item: `[x] accept` · `[ ]` pending · `[-] reject — <reason>`.

Item format:
```
### YYYY-MM-DD <session/branch> — <one-line title>
- [ ] target: <file>   change: add|edit|remove|move
- text: <exact text>
- why: <reason + evidence (file:line, command, wasted turns)>
- cost: <lines/tokens; always-loaded | path-scoped>
```

## Pending

### 2026-09-28 feat/inbox-ui-polish — stage by explicit path in a shared checkout
- [ ] target: CLAUDE.md (Workflow)   change: add
- text: `Other sessions may leave uncommitted edits in the same checkout: stage by explicit path (never git add src/ or -A), and check git show --stat after committing.`
- why: `git add src` swept another session's uncommitted auth/buyer-access files into a commit this session; undone with a soft reset before push.
- cost: 1 line, always-loaded

### 2026-09-28 feat/inbox-ui-polish — entry metadata is a snapshot; nightly refresh failure is silent
- [ ] target: MEMORY.md (project)   change: add
- text: `Inbox entries (app.entries.metadata, e.g. credit_limit_breach outstanding/over_limit) are snapshots written by the nightly refresh (pg_cron job inbox-entries-daily-refresh); detail views recompute live. On dev the job failed 2026-09-24..28 (entries_tenant_external_ref_uk vs soft-deleted rows), fixed by migration 20260928072642 (dev only). Prod not checked: verify cron.job_run_details for the job before trusting prod entry numbers.`
- why: mismatched over-limit numbers traced to a job that failed every night with no alerting; wasted several queries to find.
- cost: ~3 lines in MEMORY index + one memory file; on-demand
